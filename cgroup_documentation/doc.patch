+Extended Attributes Usage in cgroup Filesystem
+
+1. Usage
+
+cgroup filesystem supports certain types of extended attributes in its
+directories and files.  The current supported types are:
+	- Trusted (XATTR_TRUSTED)
+	- Security (XATTR_SECURITY)
+
+Both require CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to set.
+
+Like in tmpfs, the extended attributes in cgroup filesystem are stored
+using kernel memory and it's advised to keep the usage at minimum.  This
+is the reason why user defined extended attributes are not supported, since
+any user can do it and there's no limit in the value size.
+
+2. Users
+
+The current known users for this feature are SELinux to limit cgroup usage
+in containers and systemd for assorted meta data like main PID in a cgroup
+(systemd creates a cgroup per service).
